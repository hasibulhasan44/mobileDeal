              Every React component has a built-in state. This state is an
              object which stores the property values that belong to a
              component. State is able to keep data from different components
              in-sync because each state update re-renders all relevant
              components. <br /> The built-in way that React provides for
              setting component states is by using setState() and adding “local
              state” to a class. There are several other ways to manage state​s
              in React, including the use of:

                Every object with its methods and properties contains an
                internal and hidden property known as [[Prototype]]. The
                Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add
                methods and properties in objects. It is a method by which an
                object can inherit the properties and methods of another object.
                Traditionally, in order to get and set the [[Prototype]] of an
                object, we use Object.getPrototypeOf and Object.

                Unit Testing is a testing method that tests an individual unit
                of software in isolation. Unit testing for React Apps means
                testing an individual React Component. “Unit testing is a great
                discipline, which can lead to 40% – 80% reductions in bug
                density.” – Eric Elliotte.

                Facebook released React.js in March 2013 as a JavaScript
                library. Because React just provides one view, it is not
                appropriate for building an MVC architecture: you must solve the
                model and controller yourself. Besides this, there are only
                advantages and lots of advantages. One of the biggest of them is
                that React.js uses a virtual DOM that only compares the previous
                HTML code differences and only loads the different parts. This
                significantly impacts the loading times. In a positive way, of
                course. With React.js, you handle the markup and the logic in
                the same file, which means you can output variables in a view
                component (JSX). React offers a type of mobile solution for
                applications called React-Native.

                Vue.js is a JavaScript-based progressive framework for creating
                single-page applications. It was created with scalability and
                incrementality in mind, as well as ease of integration with
                other view layer frameworks. Vue is built from the bottom up to
                be progressively adaptable, unlike other monolithic frameworks.
                The core library focuses solely on the view layer, and it’s
                simple to use and connect with other libraries or applications.
                This framework’s fast learning angle is almost a trademark. It’s
                a flexible framework that may be used as a library or a
                full-fledged framework for developing large web applications.
                Vue.js combines the useful principles of the Angular and React
                frameworks and presents them in a minimalistic modern style. Web
                developers use Vue.js to create frontend user interfaces for
                web-based and hybrid mobile applications.

                AngularJS was developed in 2009 by Google. The first version was
                Angular.JS. Angular is currently known as a JavaScript
                framework. Obviously, all significant Google projects have been
                developed with Angular. Angular.js is an MVC framework. A major
                disadvantage of Angular is that it uses a regular DOM, and thus,
                the entire tree structure of the HTML tags is updated, which
                massively impacts the loading time. Angular.js has its Ionic
                framework for mobile applications.
